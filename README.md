# python-filesystem
Project from an early CS security course. Program that emulates a basic filesystem with permissions in Python.

## The task:
Create a program that emulates a filesystem with file permissions (rwx with chmod). Multiple basic commands were required: 
- ls
- touch
- mkdir
- rm
- 'vypis' (read from a file)
- 'spusti' (execute)
- cd
- 'zapis' (write to a file)
- chmod
- chown
- quit
Commands that directly worked with files (read, write, execute) were not required to actually do those things, only check permissons.
